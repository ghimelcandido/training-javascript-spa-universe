<h1>Is the Universe infinite?</h1>
<p>The limits to which we can observe the Universe are set by three things: the rate of expansion, the time since the Big Bang, and the speed of light. But beyond our visibility limit, there ought to be more Universe out there, and no one knows how far it goes on for. Is it finite or is it infinite? Although we don't know for certain, many have 
their suspicions, and scientists are working to find out as much as possible.
Although thats a huge distance, its not infinitely large; its merely the limits of what we can observe. What lies beyond that? What about the unobservable Universe? Is there any way to use what we know and measure about the Universe we inhabit to answer the question of whether it’s finite or infinite; about whether what we know of as “the Universe” goes on forever, or whether there’s some limit to what’s out there? Let’s look at the full suite of what we know today, right up to the limits of what our 
measurements tell us, and see what we can learn from it.</p>
